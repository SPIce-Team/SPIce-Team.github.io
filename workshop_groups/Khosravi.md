# MECHANICS OF SEA ICE AT SMALL SCALES

## Abstract

Discrete (or discontinuous) modeling techniques, commonly referred to as the discrete element method (DEM), have been proven to offer a new avenue for modeling the brittle mechanics of sea ice. Three intrinsic problems are associated with using current DEM techniques including: (1) unrealistic unconfined compressive to tensile strength ratio, low interlocking and rolling resistance after bond breakage, and pressure-independency of the strength characteristics
of the sea ice. This study plans to perform a parametric study to evaluate the effect of sea ice microparameters including presence and distribution of micro-cracks, particlesâ€™ internal friction angle and angularity, and bond cohesion to tensile strength ratio on the macro-properties of the sea ice.
Also, the effect of test conditions including strain rate and confinement will be investigated and
discussed. From the results of this study, a new calibration procedure will be developed that considers the sea ice behavior in the pre- and post-peak regions.
