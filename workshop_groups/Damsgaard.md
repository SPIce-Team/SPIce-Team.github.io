Ridging and rafting through compression and shear increase the
thickness and therefore also the melt resilience of sea-ice packs.
Present formulations for these mechanisms assume that ice strength
is solely governed by ice thickness, and generally treat the ice
pack as a continuum where each cell in the spatial discretization
includes many individual ice floes.  Particle-based sea ice models
with granular interactions generally represent the ice on a
floe-by-floe basis, meaning that new formulations are required for
including ridging.  We show through small-scale, high-resolution
Discrete Element Method simulations that floe-floe compression
encompasses different deformational modes, where elasticity transitions
to frictional sliding and resultant strain weakening at the onset
of ridging.  We present a generalized formulation based on elasticity
and Coulomb friction which is suitable for simulating the contact
mechanics of ridging in particle-based sea ice models.  On a larger
scale, this results in ice-pack dynamics prone to stick-slip, strain
localization, and limited compressional resistance.
