# Development of a polygon-based DEM for sea ice
S. Durski, J. Hutchings, and A. Khosravi

<i>Oregon State University</i>

## Abstract

In this talk I outline my experience working to develop a polygon-based discrete element model for sea ice intended for application from sub-synoptic to synoptic scale. With this model, we hope to develop a better understanding of where and when characteristics of sea ice exhibit scale invariance, and to delineate transitions in sea ice behavior both temporally and spatially. Here, the basics of the model are described along with its unique characteristics. Several of the challenges associated with polygon based DEMs are discussed, including grid generation, boundary condition treatment and contact physics specification with the primary objective of promoting further discussion of these topics at the workshop.
